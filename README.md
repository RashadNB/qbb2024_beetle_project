Geometric morphometric analysis of the pronotum and elytron in stag beetles: insight into its diversity and evolution: https://doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.833.26164 

# Description: 
Our project involves analyzing shape data of the elytron and pronotum across the many species of stag beetle collected and originally analyzed by Tong et al. (2021). By first organizing and plotting the data via a generalized procrustes analysis (GPA), we can conduct statistical tests to discern the elements that vary between beetles at the family, genus, and species level.

# Datasets with IDs, links:
https://www.biodiversity-science.net/fileup/1005-0094/DATA/2021160.zip Landmark coordinates of samples along with sample IDs in .TPS format along with classification files in .csv format.

# Software with versions, links: 
- XQuartz version 2.8.5 https://www.xquartz.org/
- R, latest version

# 2-3 proposed steps, with first doable <5 hours and the other 2 being a stretch:
- Organize data and make it usable. Condense data into single pronotum and elytron files, ensure sample IDs are accurate.
- Conduct GPA and plot points in morphospace.
- Stretch goal: Analyze significant differences between groups.
- Stretch goal: Maybe try to find individuals on extreme sides of morphospace and plot their landmarks to qualitatively characterize the changes PC1 and PC2 describe the most.
