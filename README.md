# Title
Recapitulating the contribution of reference cell signals to the overall transcriptome of leukemic bone marrow samples.

# Description: 
Our project involves recreating data from a study that assessed the differentiation status of KMT2A-rearranged infant ALL from bulk and single-cell transcriptome data. Our goal is to replicate heatmaps and box plots showing fetal bone marrow cell signals in leukemia subtypes and validate these signals by comparing cancer and normal cells.
