# Progress since last submission
- - pushed generated figures for Morphological Disparity (Shape Diversity) by Tribe for Elytron and Pronotum from master files generated for checkin in 1.

- - We then looked at the different tribes pronotums in terms of landmark contributions to morphological disparity. This provides insight into which groups have the most diversity in pronotum, which could provide evolutionary insights. 

- - We started to perform statistical analyses on the Elytra and Pronotum master files to start to try and understand what the PCA is showing us. Key elements of this process were to represent each beetle tribe, and test for significance between each tribe for pronotum or elytra. We did pairwise Procrustes ANOVA to see if the different tribes have significant differences in either of the shapes we have data on. We used ggplot to generate histograms of our findings. 

- - Encountered issues: pairwise comparisions would not work because of unequal group sizes due to different tribes having different numbers of observations. This resulted in no pairwise table, to quickly work through this, we filtered out tribes that have less than 2 obervations reported, this still did not resolve the issue. We would like to get significance values on the figures and might need help with this. 

- - We also tried to make a phylogeny but that proved to be unattainable. 

# Future directions
- - We will continue to delve into statistical analyses of the pronotum and elytra data and organize figures. 

# Response to peer reviewers
Reviewers has great feeback, regarding why it is important to understand beetle morphological disparities, beetles are a very diverse group of animals with many described and undescribed species. This makes them an incredible model for understanding how diversity is generated in regards to speciation, adaptation, environmantal factors etc.
